# CustomerBehavior
Analysis and modeling on customer behavior

* Feature engineering on raw customer data to group customers and product details
* Exploration of data features to see correlations
* Test out K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models to reduce product categories dimensionality
* Used product category semantic embeddings to group larger product categories from the given low-level ones (think "Electronics" instead of "computers", "cell phones")
* Prototyped a quick fastai predictive model to predict customer spending habits (bigspender=Y/N) based on all the steps above
